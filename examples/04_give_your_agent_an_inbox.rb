# Give your agent its own email address — MailKite's built-in inbox agent answers mail for you,
# no webhook server required.
#
# Point a route's action at the hosted `agent`: every email to the matched address is handed to an
# inbox agent that reads it and acts on your instructions — reply, file, or escalate.
