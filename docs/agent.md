# `agent`

Send a message to one of your inbox agents and get its reply. Defaults to the account's default agent; pass `routeId` or `address` to target a specific agent, or `model` to override the model. This is separate from inbound routing — it does not match or override routes.

**HTTP:** `POST /v1/agent`

| `routeId` | string |  | Target a specific agent by its route id (rte_…). Omit to use the account's default agent… |
| `address` | string |  | Target the agent whose route matches this address. Alternative to routeId. |
| `model` | string |  | Override the model the agent runs on for this call (e.g. claude-sonnet-4-6). |

## Returns
