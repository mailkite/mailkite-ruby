# `uploadAttachment`

Upload a file to MailKite storage and get back a secure, time-limited URL. Reference the returned `url` as an attachment in send() (`{ filename, url }`) or link it inline in your HTML — instead of base64-inlining large files on every send. Give the file ONE of four ways: a local `path` (read and streamed as raw bytes by the CLI/SDK/local MCP), a remote `url` (MailKite fetches and re-hosts it), base64 `content`, or — over raw HTTP — the file bytes as the POST body with `?filename=`. `retentionDays` (7/30/90/365, default 7) sets how long the file and URL live.

**HTTP:** `POST /v1/attachments`
